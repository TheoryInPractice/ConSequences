## Quantum Programming Labs from Alexandru Gheorghiu

These programming labs are drawn from a recent [course on Quantum Computation and Cryptography](http://workshop.rosedu.org/2016/sesiuni/quantum-comp). 
The full course materials are available on the web site.

Each lab folder includes a PDF file with some background material and the exercises, a starter F# script file, and an F# script file with the solutions.
Note that lab 2 has two starter and solution files, and includes a DLL that implements oracle functions required for the exercises.

[Lab 1](Lab_1) covers the basics of writing a quantum circuit.
[Lab 2](Lab_2) implements classic quantum algorithms such as Deutch-Josza, Grover search, the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb detector, and the swap test.
[Lab 3](Lab_3) showcases some applications of entanglement, such as the Ekert '91 key distribution protocol.
[Lab 4](Lab_4) investigates quantum error correction.
